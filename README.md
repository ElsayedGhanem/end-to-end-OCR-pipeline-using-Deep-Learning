# End-to-End OCR Pipeline

This project implements an **end-to-end Optical Character Recognition (OCR) pipeline** that combines text detection and recognition on images using deep learning and open-source OCR libraries.

---

## üìå **Project Overview**

‚úÖ Detect text regions in images using the EAST model.  
‚úÖ Crop and preprocess detected text regions.  
‚úÖ Recognize text using two approaches:
- EasyOCR
- PyTesseract

‚úÖ Evaluate the predictions using:
- Character Error Rate (CER)
- Word Error Rate (WER)

‚úÖ Visualize results and analyze errors.

## üîç **Technologies & Libraries**

- Python
- OpenCV
- EasyOCR
- PyTesseract
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## üöÄ **Pipeline Steps**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Loading
- Mount Google Drive in Colab.
- Load images and corresponding ground truth annotation files.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Text Detection
- Use pretrained EAST model to detect text bounding boxes.
- Decode and apply non-max suppression to extract high-confidence boxes.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Cropping
- Use bounding boxes to crop text regions from the original image.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Text Recognition
- **EasyOCR** for recognition.
- **PyTesseract** for alternative recognition baseline.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluation
- Compute CER (Character Error Rate) and WER (Word Error Rate) for predictions.
- Aggregate average metrics for comparison.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
- Display cropped regions with ground truth, prediction, CER, and WER.
- Highlight hardest cases (high CER) for error analysis.

## üìä **Results & Comparison**

| Approach     | Detection Model | Recognition Model | Avg CER | Avg WER | Notes / Observations                     |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| EasyOCR       | EAST            | EasyOCR           | *0.306* | *0.667* | Best accuracy on our cropped images.     |
| PyTesseract   | EAST            | PyTesseract       | *0.444* | *0.450* | Slightly faster but worse on small text. |

## üß™ **Example Visualization**

Example cropped regions with predicted vs ground truth text, and calculated CER/WER scores.

## ‚ùóÔ∏è **Error Analysis**

- High CER/WER often observed on:
  - Very small or low-resolution text regions.
  - Stylized or warped fonts.
  - Blurry images.

- Suggested improvements:
  - Apply image preprocessing (thresholding, resizing).
  - Use better OCR models (e.g., trained CRNN, Transformers).
  - Fine-tune detection for rotated or curved text.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Mount your Google Drive.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ Set paths to your images and annotation text files.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ Run all cells.
